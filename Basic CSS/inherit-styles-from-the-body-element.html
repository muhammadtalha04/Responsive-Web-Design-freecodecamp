  In this example I learnt about how a child element inherits styling from its parent element. I practiced this by making an h1 element and doing the styling in the parent element.

<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: green;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
